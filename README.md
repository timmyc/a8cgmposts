## a8cgmposts

This be a simple script that grabs all the posts tagged with #a8cgm from the WordPress.com API ( public posts returned only ), and then creates posts about those posts at a8cgmposts.wordpress.com.  From there, the magic of publicize will spread the good word to twitter and maybe other places too??

The script leverages the power of WIDGETS to keep track of the last time the script was run, and only requests newer posts.  Widgets make the world go-round.
